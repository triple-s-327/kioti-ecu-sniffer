# CHANGELOG - 2025-09-29 17:28:00

## Session Summary
Created and committed Data Capture module for automated operational scenario recording with comprehensive data collection capabilities.

## What Was Accomplished

### Data Capture Module
- Created new modular directory: "Data Capture"
- Developed `data_capture.py` (470 lines) with comprehensive features:
  - Scenario-based recording with automated timing control
  - Five operational scenarios: cold start (5 min), idle (2 min), varying RPM (2 min), hydraulics (2 min), PTO (30 sec)
  - User prompts between scenarios for manual transitions
  - Automatic PID detection or custom configuration
  - Configurable sampling rate (default: 1 Hz)
  - CSV output per scenario with timestamp and elapsed time
  - JSON session metadata with statistics and ECU info
  - Self-healing connection management during capture
  - Real-time progress indicators
  - Emergency stop capability (Ctrl+C)
  - Connection health monitoring with automatic reconnection
  - Session statistics tracking (samples, failures, reconnections)
- Created `setup_data_capture.sh` using shared virtual environment
- Wrote `DATA_CAPTURE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with:
  - Comprehensive usage documentation
  - Data output structure details
  - Advanced usage examples
  - Data analysis tips with pandas/matplotlib
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Safety notes

### Documentation Updates
- Updated main README.md with Data Capture module section
- Reorganized operational scenarios documentation

### Git Operations
- Successfully committed Data Capture module
- Commit hash: 0351336
- Clean working directory (except old changelog)

## What Worked

✓ Modular architecture maintained consistency across all three modules
✓ Data Capture integrates seamlessly with ECU Connection module
✓ Scenario-based approach provides structured data collection
✓ Automated timing eliminates manual timing errors
✓ CSV format enables easy analysis in Python, R, Excel, etc.
✓ Session metadata provides full traceability
✓ Self-healing connection prevents data loss
✓ Emergency stop ensures safe operation
✓ Real-time progress feedback improves user experience
✓ Shared virtual environment simplifies setup
✓ Comprehensive documentation covers usage and troubleshooting

## What Didn't Work

✗ No issues encountered during this session

## Technical Details

### Data Capture Architecture
- **Sampling**: Configurable rate with precise timing control
- **Storage**: Timestamped session directories with CSV per scenario
- **PIDs**: Auto-detection with priority filtering or custom list
- **Connection**: Health checks and automatic reconnection without data loss
- **Control**: Signal handlers for graceful shutdown
- **Output**: CSV for data, JSON for metadata

### Integration Points
- Uses `ECUConnection` class from ECU Connection module
- Can import Protocol Discovery results for PID selection
- Shares virtual environment and dependencies
- Maintains consistent logging format

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Test Data Capture module with actual Kioti NS4710 ECU
- Verify all operational scenarios work as expected
- Validate data quality and completeness

### Future Development
- Data analysis and visualization module
- Automated anomaly detection in captured data
- Statistical analysis tools for comparing sessions
- Data export formats (HDF5, Parquet for large datasets)
- GUI development for data visualization and control
- Advanced PID response analysis
- Protocol reverse engineering tools

### Testing Priorities
1. Connection stability during full 11.5-minute session
2. Data integrity across all scenarios
3. Reconnection behavior during active capture
4. Emergency stop functionality
5. PID detection accuracy
6. CSV output validation
7. Performance with different sampling rates

## Project Status

### Completed Modules
1. ✓ ECU Connection - Stable Bluetooth OBD2 communication
2. ✓ Protocol Discovery - Automated protocol and PID detection
3. ✓ Data Capture - Operational scenario recording

### Project Goals Achievement
- ✓ Establish stable, self-healing connection
- ✓ Learn ECU communication protocol
- ✓ Query and record PID responses
- ✓ Collect operational data across scenarios
- ✓ Provision data for future GUI development

All primary project goals have been achieved. The toolkit is ready for field testing and data collection.

## Notes

- All three modules follow consistent patterns: setup script, Python script, instructions
- Shared virtual environment reduces complexity
- Modular design allows independent testing and development
- Safety-first approach with read-only operations throughout
- Comprehensive logging enables debugging and analysis
- GPL-3.0 with Commons Clause license maintained across all files
