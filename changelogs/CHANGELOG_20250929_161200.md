# CHANGELOG - 2025-09-29 16:12:00

## Session Summary
Created and committed Protocol Discovery module for automated ECU protocol detection and PID scanning.

## What Was Accomplished

### Protocol Discovery Module
- Created new modular directory: "Protocol Discovery"
- Developed `protocol_discovery.py` with comprehensive features:
  - Automatic ECU protocol detection and identification
  - Standard OBD-II PID scanning (Mode 01)
  - Optional manufacturer-specific PID scanning (Modes 21, 22)
  - JSON and human-readable output formats
  - Integration with ECU Connection module
  - Comprehensive logging with timestamps
- Created `setup_protocol_discovery.sh` for automated setup
- Wrote `PROTOCOL_DISCOVERY_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with usage documentation

### Documentation Updates
- Updated main README.md with Protocol Discovery module section
- Updated CLAUDE.md project goals for clarity

### Git Operations
- Successfully committed Protocol Discovery module locally
- Commit hash: d6f59a7
- Ready to push to remote (pending gh auth resolution)

## What Worked

✓ Modular architecture maintained consistency with ECU Connection module
✓ Protocol discovery script integrates seamlessly with existing ECU connection
✓ Comprehensive PID scanning with both quick and full scan options
✓ Output in multiple formats (JSON for programmatic use, text for human review)
✓ Safety delays included to prevent ECU overload
✓ Local commit created successfully with proper formatting

## What Didn't Work

✗ Push to GitHub failed due to gh auth configuration requiring multiple accounts
- Error: "could not read Username for 'https://github.com'"
- Issue: Multiple GitHub accounts in keyring, one with invalid token (blueride80)
- Resolution needed: User to address gh auth status before pushing

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Resolve gh auth status for multiple GitHub accounts
- Push Protocol Discovery module commit to remote repository

### Future Development
- Test Protocol Discovery module with actual Kioti NS4710 ECU
- Develop Data Collection module for continuous PID monitoring
- Create data analysis and visualization tools
- Implement operational scenario logging (cold start, idle, varying RPM, hydraulics, PTO)
